# FLOW Spec Layer

Use this folder for durable, tool-agnostic specs that should outlive a single agent session. A spec starts when an idea becomes committed work, but before implementation details harden in code.

`docs/superpowers/` remains a useful archive for skill-generated designs and implementation plans. New FlowMe-owned specs should live here unless a user explicitly asks for a tool-specific location. When a skill writes to `docs/superpowers/`, link that artifact from the matching `docs/specs/` folder instead of duplicating it.

## When To Create A Spec

Create a spec folder for:

- New user-facing flows, workbenches, exports, or route behavior.
- Content conversion batches that affect public availability, source/risk labels, or artifact output.
- Data model, storage, event logging, auth, deployment, or security changes.
- Harness/process changes that future agents need to follow.
- Any task that needs more than one implementation pass or more than one verification mode.

Do not create a spec folder for:

- A typo or small wording fix.
- A single local test adjustment with no behavior or process change.
- A one-off investigation that ends with no committed product direction.

## Folder Shape

Use one folder per committed scope:

```text
docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-short-topic/
  spec.md
  plan.md
  tasks.md
  qa.md
```

Keep the short topic stable. If the work is rescoped, update the files inside the folder rather than creating a second near-duplicate folder.

## Required Gates

Every FlowMe spec should answer these gates before implementation starts:

- **Stage fit:** Why this belongs in the current Stage 0 or Stage 1 scope.
- **First user action:** What the user should do first, and what completion looks like.
- **Artifact destination:** What becomes calendar, sheet, memo, exported text, or internal check state.
- **Source/risk boundary:** How official facts, creator experience, user edits, and cautions stay separate.
- **Natural artifact:** What a user would naturally create outside FLOW with realistic input values.
- **Verification:** Which docs, unit, build, E2E, browser, content, or security checks prove the change.

## Promotion Rules

- Use [../IDEAS.md](../IDEAS.md) for promising but uncommitted ideas.
- Use [../DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md) for settled product, UX, technical, or process choices that future specs should inherit.
- Promote an idea into `docs/specs/` when it becomes planned work.
- When promoting an idea, carry forward the original "why not now" risk and update it into a concrete stage-fit statement, scope boundary, or non-goal.
- When a spec settles a reusable policy while planning, add or link the durable rule in [../DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md) so later work can inherit it without rereading the whole spec.
- Keep [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) short; link to the spec instead of copying details.
- Record implementation evidence in [../pr-history/README.md](../pr-history/README.md) and the matching PR history entry.
- Update [../STATUS.md](../STATUS.md) only for current health, focus, or recently completed changes.

## Template

Start from [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) when creating a new spec folder.
