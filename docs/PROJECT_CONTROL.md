# FlowMe Project Control

**Last Updated:** 2026-08-13

**Purpose:** Stable entry point for the current FlowMe stage, evidence boundary, and next owner decision.

This file is an index, not a second source of product truth. Update its links after a meaningful stage or release change. Keep dated reports as immutable evidence snapshots.

[PR #182](https://github.com/knhbae/flowme2605/pull/182) final head
`0aca76687ac582ff4cf11b19a0f46db5593c768e` passed exact-head CI run
[`31655643163`](https://github.com/knhbae/flowme2605/actions/runs/31655643163)
and merged at `2026-08-13T01:05:33Z` as
`f6f796c035d5762eea07ec35abb7f1af1577a5a5`. GitHub Production deployment
record `5880059975`, status `16743295490`, reports success for that exact
runtime-bearing merge; its
[protected direct deployment-record URL](https://flowme2605-hph3l1si0-flowme.vercel.app)
is deployment evidence. Canonical Production smoke against
[flowme2605.vercel.app](https://flowme2605.vercel.app) passed `41/41` with
workers `1`, retries `0`, in `264804.24ms`, with unexpected, flaky, and skipped
results `0`.

The release gives executable single-plan Maps the same shared Item title, memo,
and date editor as ordinary Flows while preserving Map/version/child/storage
identity and the PR #178 Plan edit/lifecycle foundation. Post-merge `main` run
[`31656595092`](https://github.com/knhbae/flowme2605/actions/runs/31656595092)
passed core job `94312307779` and Playwright job `94312307849`.
Automated QA, deployment, smoke, and local capture reports remain separate from
observed-user validation; observed users remain `0`. No product gate is active.

## Canonical Project Truth

| Question | Canonical document |
| --- | --- |
| What is active, blocked, or required now? | [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) |
| What sequence or backlog is committed? | [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) |
| Which multi-step scope is active, gated, completed, or historical? | [specs/README.md](./specs/README.md) |
| Which product or process rules are settled? | [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) |
| Which directions remain deferred? | [IDEAS.md](./IDEAS.md) |
| What routes, components, and ownership contracts exist? | [SERVICE_STRUCTURE.md](./SERVICE_STRUCTURE.md) |
| What has actually been released? | [HISTORY.md](./HISTORY.md) |
| Where is older status detail preserved? | [STATUS_HISTORY.md](./STATUS_HISTORY.md) |

## Update Policy

- Update this index after a meaningful release, stage change, or whole-project review.
- Do not continuously rewrite dated HTML reports. Generate a new dated report and update the two current-view links here.
- Keep one active product gate consistent across `STATUS`, `ROADMAP`, and `specs/README`.
- When no product gate is active, state that explicitly instead of treating a research or maintenance shelf as implementation work.
- Treat implementation, automated QA, deployment, and observed-user evidence as separate states.
- Use [Knowledge Maintenance](./workflows/knowledge-maintenance.md) only on demand when these documents drift or become difficult to navigate.
