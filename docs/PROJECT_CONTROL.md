# FlowMe Project Control

**Last Updated:** 2026-08-09

**Purpose:** Stable entry point for the current FlowMe stage, evidence boundary, and next owner decision.

This file is an index, not a second source of product truth. Update its links after a meaningful stage or release change. Keep dated reports as immutable evidence snapshots.

## Current View

- [Current status and owner action](./STATUS.md)
- [Current roadmap and inactive shelves](./ROADMAP.md)
- [Completed workspace and backlog stabilization](./specs/2026-08-06-workspace-backlog-stabilization/spec.md)
- [Final worktree and preservation inventory](./specs/2026-08-06-workspace-backlog-stabilization/inventory.md)
- [R3A My Flow experience boundary release](./pr-history/2026-08-09-r3a-my-flow-experience-boundary.md)
- [P35 Round 2 MVP production closeout](./pr-history/2026-08-06-p35-round2-mvp-closeout-production.md)

R3A is durable on `main` through PR #169 as product-source commit
`95a69257c73633077df2305232299f58cca03f73`. Vercel deployment
`dpl_5jhJz4EBiHMm5HptH9nFCqfyeFek` reached `READY`, and production smoke passed
for the unchanged classic default and exact-query internal `r3a-lab` route.
Observed-user validation remains `0`. No next product slice is active until the
owner promotes one.

## Canonical Project Truth

| Question | Canonical document |
| --- | --- |
| What is active, blocked, or required now? | [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) |
| What sequence or backlog is committed? | [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) |
| Which multi-step scope is active, gated, completed, or historical? | [specs/README.md](./specs/README.md) |
| Which product or process rules are settled? | [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) |
| Which directions remain deferred? | [IDEAS.md](./IDEAS.md) |
| What routes, components, and ownership contracts exist? | [SERVICE_STRUCTURE.md](./SERVICE_STRUCTURE.md) |
| What has actually been released? | [HISTORY.md](./HISTORY.md) |
| Where is older status detail preserved? | [STATUS_HISTORY.md](./STATUS_HISTORY.md) |

## Update Policy

- Update this index after a meaningful release, stage change, or whole-project review.
- Do not continuously rewrite dated HTML reports. Generate a new dated report and update the two current-view links here.
- Keep one active product gate consistent across `STATUS`, `ROADMAP`, and `specs/README`.
- When no product gate is active, state that explicitly instead of treating a research or maintenance shelf as implementation work.
- Treat implementation, automated QA, deployment, and observed-user evidence as separate states.
- Use [Knowledge Maintenance](./workflows/knowledge-maintenance.md) only on demand when these documents drift or become difficult to navigate.
